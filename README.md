# AFG Dashboard

The idea of this project was to create a simple tool to visualize NDVI time series in different regions of Afghanistan (read from a CSV file).

2 different dashboards have been implemented: one with **Tableau** and one with **Streamlit**

## Usage

 ### Tableau 
 (Tableau license required)
 - To run in locally: open Book.twb with Tableau
 - To open the app:  https://analytics.wfp.org/t/Public/views/AFG_NDVI/Dashboard?:showAppBanner=false&:display_count=n&:showVizHome=n&:origin=viz_share_link
 
  ### Streamlit
 - To run in locally: run `python -m streamlit run mainScript.py` in the cmd
 - To open the app:  https://share.streamlit.io/juholland/afg_streamlit/main/mainScript.py
 
 
## Status

We decided to keep the Tableau version. 
Project on hold since we don't have enough Tableau license for now
